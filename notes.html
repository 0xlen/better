  <p>Today I was depressed due to two orders did not be delivered due to service bug, the customer service did not help me and I need to write email to claim. 3rd order with UberEats also got issue. Whatever, at least I am still feel grateful because I have food to eat. Sometimes just try to think it in another way, things will get better. I knew getting mad doesn’t help, so still appreciate to anyone who reviewed my orders and tried to help me figure out.<br />
Three things I felt thankful: (1) still have food to eat although delivery was missing (2) had a lazy day to slow down (3) learned new lession regarding preparing course from a good engineer</p>

  <p>Starting to do journaling because I noticed my mental health issue needs to find a way out. Since last year, I started to aware that I was in the path to burnout, and it’s time to start write down something as it might be helpful.</p>

<p>It was the first time I got cold in Ireland and it is totally breaking my working belief, start to thinking I should treat myself well, because it has been a while I never really take a reset.</p>

<p>I can feel depression, lose motivation and not in interested to thing what I love sometimes. But I figured out try to do things slow looks like helps, try to do less, focus on one thing.</p>

<p>Things to focus:</p>
<ul>
  <li>have good sleep (sleep before 11:00 PM)</li>
  <li>use balance app and do meditation 10-15 minutes everyday</li>
</ul>

<p>Three gratitude things today: (1) start writing daily note (2) had time to enjoy <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">It's Kind of a Funny Story</code> (3) have warm, sunny and good weather</p>
