    Starting to do journaling because I noticed my mental health issue needs to find a way out. Since last year, I started to aware that I was in the path to burnout, and it's time to start write down something as it might be helpful.

    It was the first time I got cold in Ireland and it is totally breaking my working belief, start to thinking I should treat myself well, because it has been a while I never really take a reset.

    I can feel depression, lose motivation and not in interested to thing what I love sometimes. But I figured out try to do things slow looks like helps, try to do less, focus on one thing.

    Things to focus:
      - have good sleep (sleep before 11:00 PM)
      - use balance app and do meditation 10-15 minutes everyday

    Three gratitude things today: (1) start writing daily note (2) had time to enjoy `It's Kind of a Funny Story` (3) have warm, sunny and good weather
